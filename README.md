# Final_Project
My Missile Command can be found here --->>

This is a game that I built in HTML5 Canvas.
Canvas is a replacement for flash and as such is great for building games in.

For my final project I decided to teach myself the basics of game development using canvas and wanted to build something retro
and as such decided on Missile Command.

All the languages I used are:

HTML 
CSS
jQuery
Javascript
Canvas
